  === Overview ===

In this set of activities we are going to explore a small subset of Alpine DataMiner's features and use these to create two alternate prediction models for a moderately large data set.  We will compare these prediction models using a graph called an ROC.
Before we set about this task we need to be able to reliably execute certain elementary atomic tasks that will be needed repeatedly.





  === Elementary Tasks ===

* task 2


  ==== Create a Flow ====

==== Connect two modules with a flow ====

* task 1
* task 2


==== Set properties on a module ====

* task 1
* task 2


==== Import Data from a CSV file ====

* task 1
* task 2


==== Remap/rename certain columns on imported data ====

==== Create a Join definition ====

==== Run a flow ====
