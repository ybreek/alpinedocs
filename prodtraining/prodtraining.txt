Alpine Product Training
=======================



== Overview

In this set of activities we are going to explore a small subset of Alpine DataMiner's features and use these to create two alternate prediction models for a moderately large data set.  We will compare these prediction models using a graph called an ROC.
Before we set about this task we need to be able to reliably execute certain elementary atomic tasks that will be needed repeatedly.


=== Elementary Tasks ===  

=== Log in to Alpine Data Miner ====



=== Create a connection ====


=== Create a Flow ====

=== Connect two modules with a flow ====



=== Set properties on a module ====


=== Import Data from a CSV file ====


=== Remap/rename certain columns on imported data ====

=== Create a Join definition ====

=== Run a flow ====


=== Tasks ===

* Import data from file ORD_2008
* Import data from file carriers.txt

* Initial flow

* summary stats
* null val rep
* box plot
* scatter plot

* join
* improved box plot


* variable selection
* sampling
* training 
** logreg
** naive bayes
* validation
* ROC
** nb, logreg, val as inputs
* LogReg Predictor
** variable, logreg as inputs

=== Preamble (TBD) ===
* login
* permissions
* connection
